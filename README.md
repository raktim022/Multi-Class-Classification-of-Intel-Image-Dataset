# Multi-Class-Classification-using-VGG16-model

I used a VGG16 model for multi-class classification of Intel image dataset.

There were six types of images in the dataset : Buliding, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea and Street.

I trained the model for 1 epoch. Time taken was 160 minutes.

After building the model and predicting the labels of some unseen data, I used Flask REST API to make an app to launch the model.
